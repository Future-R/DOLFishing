"This might be a bit awkward. No not there! That's it. Now we can both reach <<phim>>. You two, you need to help too. If this doesn't remove the taint, nothing will." They recommence their licking. This time though, two tongues assault your <<genitals 1>>.

"Centuries ago, there was a monastic schism. A disagreement between beliefs. One group eventually went on to found the temple we stand in now. The other dissolved."
